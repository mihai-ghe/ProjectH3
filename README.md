# ProjectH3

This is the project I made for HHH ( Healthcare in Hospitals Hackathon ). The scope of this Hackathon was to develop inovative solutions in the medical field using artificial intelligence. This program uses sqlite as the database technology. The way this would work in theory is: whenever a user is prescribed medication by a doctor for a certain diagnosis, the application will retrieve the all the other meds the user is taking from a database and see if there are any adverse effects ( as a result of interaction between the meds the patient is taking already and what the doctor is prescribing him ) with what the doctor wants to prescribe. The app will show these results to the doctor helping him make an informed decision in regards to what medication would be most suitable for the patient. This POC includes a demo from the perspective of the user and one from the perspective of a doctor.
